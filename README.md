## A Way To Use Configuration INI Data


</div>

### Description

Ever had an application that had a large INI file for its configuration settings? Did you have loads of public variables all over the place just to store the setting for something? Well, in this demo project you can make use of Hash Tables (or "Linked Lists") which are stored in memory and can be called at anytime during the application's runtime. Works similar to the built in collection but is a lot faster at finding, adding and removing data than the collection. I have implimented several functions to save the need to learn how the class module works such as hMake, hFree, hAdd, hDel, hFind, hGet, SaveHashToINI and LoadINIToHash. You would normally hMake the hash first, then hAdd data, hGet(table,item) would retrieve data of the item from the table, hDel(table,item) would remove, etc. Works similar to mIRC's hash functions. Hash tables are great in my opinion and I love utilizing them where ever I can. Note: I am not the original author of the cHashTable.cls file and I'm not sure who is, so credit goes to whoever wrote it. Please enjoy my code and vote for it ;)
